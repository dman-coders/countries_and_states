A sample list of Countries and States (Initially USA, Canada & Mexico) as a taxonomy vocabulary - supplied as a feature using UUID import (as opposed to taxonomy_xml import).

The vocabulary includes an additional "abbreviation" text field (eg TX,CA,NY) for each term.

Built as a sample for testing taxonomy distributions.
